Click 'OK' to close all tabs if they seem to have loaded. Or just drag out the Attack Tool's Tab to continue the attacks in a fresh Window. You can close previous Window(s) after all the tabs inside have loaded. Will suggest not to click 'Cancel' as the attack will then continue in the same window and cause memory shortage. It's a lengthy message, but worth it.`)) {

InfiniteBonks
****************************************************************************************************

It does exactly what it says - Opens up Infinite Tabs with the URL that you pass in the UI, an HTTP/HTTPS GET attack, backed up by Crash Protection, where opened windows are auto-closed for RAM relief.

Just run it in your TOR browser.
Bookmark it for ease of access.
Pass your desired URL.
Click the 'Go Bonkers!' button.
Watch the website die out slowly.
You might wish to go and get a cup of coffee by this time.

FYI : Before running the InfiniteBonks tool, remember to Whitelist it in the Browser Settings. Menu (top right) -> Options -> Privacy & Security (left side menu) -> Block pop-up windows (scroll down) -> Exceptions -> add the url of the file

Also, after every 1000th attack it will auto-close previous 1000 tabs to preserve memory. You can vary the frequency of auto-close operation on need basis (var autoCloseFrequency).

NOTE:
I wrote these tools for researching ways to Stress Test an onion site (a Darknet / Deepweb / Darkweb site).
Please use it for research purpose only.

Cons:
(1) May result in taking down the TOR Network.
(2) RAM Intensive.
