# InfiniteBonks (A Stress Testing Tool for Darknet Sites)
It does exactly what it says - Opens up Infinite Tabs with the URL that you pass in the UI, an HTTP/HTTPS GET attack, backed up by Crash Protection, where opened windows are auto-closed for RAM relief.  

Just run it in your **TOR** browser.  
Bookmark it for ease of access.  
Pass your desired URL.  
Click the '**Go Bonkers!**' button.  
Watch the website die out slowly.  
You might wish to go and get a cup of coffee by this time.  

**_FYI : Before running the InfiniteBonks tool, remember to Whitelist it in the Browser Settings. 
Menu (top right) -> Options -> Privacy & Security (left side menu) -> Block pop-up windows (scroll down) -> Exceptions -> add the url of the file_**  

**_Also, after every 1000th attack it will auto-close previous 1000 tabs to preserve memory. You can vary the frequency of auto-close operation on need basis (var autoCloseFrequency)._**


**NOTE:**  
I wrote these tools for researching ways to Stress Test an onion site (a Darknet / Deepweb / Darkweb site).  
Please use it for research purpose only.  

**Cons:**  
(1) May result in taking down the TOR Network.  
(2) RAM Intensive.
